# IONKARE Security Modernization PRD

## Executive Summary
IONKARE's security modernization initiative transforms our healthcare coordination platform into a cloud-native, security-first solution that exceeds industry compliance requirements while delivering exceptional developer and security team experiences.

### Vision Statement
Enable healthcare teams to coordinate care securely and efficiently by providing a modern, compliant platform that's secure by default and transparent by design.

### Strategic Pillars
1. **Security as Code**: Infrastructure, policy, and compliance managed through version control
2. **Cloud Agnostic**: Consistent security baseline across AWS, Azure, and GCP
3. **Operational Excellence**: Automated detection, response, and compliance validation
4. **Developer Experience**: Security tools integrated into development workflow

## Success Metrics

### Security Posture
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) < 15 minutes
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) < 1 hour
- Zero critical findings in external audits
- 100% of infrastructure defined as code

### Developer Experience
- < 5 minute CI security scan time
- < 1% false positive rate in SAST
- Zero-touch security for common patterns
- Same-day security review turnaround

### Operational Excellence
- 99.9% alert accuracy
- < 5% alert fatigue rate
- 100% automated compliance checks
- Zero manual security operations

## Stakeholder Requirements

### Development Teams
- Clear security requirements
