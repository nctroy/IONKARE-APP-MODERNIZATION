# IONKARE Modernization Security Strategy and Architecture

## Scope
This document defines the security strategy, controls, and operational practices for the modernization of the Ionkare healthcare coordination platform. It is intended to guide design decisions, delivery, audit readiness, and ongoing operations.

## Guiding Principles
- Least privilege and zero trust
- Defense in depth, secure by default
- Shift left and DevSecOps in the SDLC
- Privacy by design and data minimization
- Encryption by default in transit and at rest
- Auditability, observability, and accountability
- Cloud native controls first, standards mapped

## Control Frameworks and Standards
- NIST CSF and NIST 800-53 (Moderate baseline for healthcare)
- CIS Controls v8 and CIS Benchmarks for cloud and OS hardening
- ISO 27001 ISMS with ISO 27002 control catalog
- SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
- HIPAA Security Rule (with HITRUST optional for extended mapping)
- OWASP ASVS and OWASP Top 10 for application controls
- SLSA, SSDF (NIST 800-218), SBOM for supply chain security

## Cloud Native Security Architecture (AWS example)
- Organization and Landing Zone: multi account, SCP guardrails, IAM Identity Center
- Network: VPC per environment, private subnets for services, public only for edge (ALB, CloudFront), WAF enabled, Security Groups restrictive by default, VPC endpoints for private egress to AWS APIs
- Identity and Keys: IAM roles for workloads, no long lived keys; KMS CMKs for data at rest; AWS Secrets Manager for secrets; short lived credentials in CI
- Data: RDS Postgres with encryption and TLS, ElastiCache Redis with TLS, S3 with SSE KMS, object lock and bucket policies, lifecycle and retention
- Edge: CloudFront, WAF, Shield, managed rules, rate limiting, bot control where applicable
- Detection and Audit: CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, Detective, Security Hub, centralized logs
- Governance: Tagging policy, config conformance packs, OPA based policy as code for Terraform

## Application Security
- Authentication: modern session or JWT cookies with rotation, optional MFA for privileged actions
- Authorization: role based access and attribute based claims, least privilege endpoints, resource scoping
- Session and Input: CSRF protection, input validation and output encoding, strict content security policy, security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy), secure cookies, rate limits per user and IP
- Password storage: Argon2id or bcrypt with strong work factors; credential leak detection
- File and Media: S3 presigned uploads, type and size validation, server side scanning, image processing in sandboxed workers
- APIs: idempotency keys for POST where relevant, pagination caps, robust error handling without sensitive leakage

## Data Security and Privacy
- Data classification and inventory; PHI and PII minimization
- Encryption in transit TLS 1.2 plus and modern ciphers; at rest with KMS and key rotation
- Tokenization or pseudonymization for sensitive identifiers where feasible
- Backups encrypted, tested restores, defined retention by data type
- DLP at egress boundaries; access reviews and approvals for PHI data sets

## DevSecOps and SDLC Controls
- Source: branch protection, mandatory reviews, signed commits recommended, secret scanning pre commit and in CI (gitleaks)
- SAST: CodeQL or Semgrep on pull requests with severity gates
- Dependency scanning: npm audit plus Snyk or Dependabot, Ruby gems if used, vulnerability gates with override process
- IaC scanning: Checkov or tfsec for Terraform, policy as code with OPA Conftest
- Container scanning: Trivy or Grype for images; minimal base images; non root users
- SBOM and Supply chain: Syft to generate SBOM, cosign to sign images, provenance attestations (SLSA)
- DAST and Fuzzing: OWASP ZAP for authenticated flows, selective fuzz targets for parsers
- Secrets: no secrets in code; use Secrets Manager; automated rotation for DB and API keys
- CI CD: least privilege IAM for pipelines, environment separation, manual approvals for prod

## Logging, Monitoring, and Telemetry
- Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs; centralized log aggregation
- Metrics and tracing via OpenTelemetry; application and infrastructure dashboards
- WAF, ALB, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, GuardDuty events forwarded centrally
- Log retention and immutability: S3 with object lock for audit trails

## Threat Modeling (STRIDE overview)
- Spoofing: enforce strong auth, mTLS or verified JWT between services, key rotation
- Tampering: integrity checks, signed artifacts, content hashes, WORM logs
- Repudiation: comprehensive audit logs with user and request context, clock sync
- Information disclosure: least privilege, encryption, field level redaction in logs
- Denial of service: WAF rate limits, autoscaling, circuit breakers, backpressure
- Elevation of privilege: robust authorization checks on every boundary, admin isolation

### Threat Model Register (template)
| ID | Component | Threat | Control | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TM 001 | Auth API | Credential stuffing | WAF bot rules, rate limit, breached password check | High | Planned |
| TM 002 | Media upload | Malware upload | AV scan, type sniffing, sandbox processing | High | Planned |

## Risk Register (template)
| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Rating | Owner | Mitigation | Status | Review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R 001 | PHI exposure via misconfigured S3 | Medium | High | High | Security | SCP, bucket policies, DLP, monitoring | Open | Quarterly |

## Vulnerability and Patch Management
- Scanning cadence: continuous for code and containers; monthly for OS AMIs
- SLAs: Critical 7 days, High 14 days, Medium 30 days, Low 90 days; exception process documented

## Incident Response and SOC Integration
- Playbooks: auth abuse, data exfiltration, ransomware, supply chain, DDoS
- Tooling: SIEM (Splunk or Datadog), SOAR (XSOAR or alternatives), ticketing (Jira or ServiceNow), on call (PagerDuty)
- Integrations: CloudTrail, GuardDuty, WAF, VPC Flow Logs, EDR, application logs; automated enrichment and containment where safe
- Severity matrix, RACI, comms plan, forensics workflow, evidence handling
- RTO RPO targets by service; regular tabletop exercises

## Compliance and Audit Readiness
- Control mapping: maintain system security plan and control matrix across NIST, SOC 2, HIPAA
- Evidence collection: automated via CI CD, cloud config snapshots, access reviews, change logs
- Policies and procedures: information security policy set, SDLC, access control, incident response, vendor risk, DR, privacy
- Training: annual security and privacy training; secure coding for engineers

## Business Continuity and DR
- Backups tested quarterly; cross AZ HA by default; optional cross region for critical data
- Defined RTO RPO per capability; failover runbooks validated

## Privacy and Legal
- Data inventory and data protection impact assessments for PHI flows
- Consent and purpose limitation; data subject request handling; retention schedules
- Vendor management and BAAs with any processor that handles PHI

## Open Items and Decisions Needed
- Finalize target SIEM and SOAR platforms
- Confirm PHI data elements to store versus derive on demand
- Define production RTO RPO per service tier

## Appendices
- Security headers checklist: HSTS, CSP, XFO deny, XCTO nosniff, RP strict origin when cross origin
- Default rate limits by endpoint class
- Reference architectures and runbooks locations
